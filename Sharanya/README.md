Welcome to my workspace for the AirFly project!
This folder contains all my contributions, including code implementations, dataset references, results, and milestone updates.

Throughout this project, I’ll be documenting each phase — from data preprocessing and model development to evaluation and final insights.
You’ll find links to datasets I’ve used, experiment outputs, anyone can easily follow the progress and results.
